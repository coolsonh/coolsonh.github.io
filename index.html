	<h>Brief Reflective on the Project:</h>
	<p class="Information" style=" font-family: sans-serif;">
		<br>
		When I initially proposed this project, I had the intention to use the base WebGL standard, without any additional frameworks. But, I discovered after an attempt on a prototype with WebGL, that I would not be able to finish anything that looks well enough to present in the time given.<br><br>
		I then looked for a framework that could help me accomplish my goals. I even found one that the WebGL book created. I ultimately went with Three.js, which was well documented and had the features I required.<br><br>
		There was still much to learn about the framework and WebGL and I didn't have a lot of time left. So I condensed my original plan down to one scene. This allowed me to fulfill the requirements while still providing a visual appealing project.<br><br>
		One thing I would do differently in the future is to plan better on what tools I would in creating the project. As I was unfamiliar with WebGL, I spent much of the project researching it's language and capabilities. I would have certainly been able to accomplish more had I been familiar with it before hand.<br><br>
		However, now that I've had some experience, I look forward to using computer graphics and WebGL in future projects. Where I will continue to grow as a computer scientist.<br><br>
